This project is based on [angular-seed][https://github.com/angular/angular-seed],

It is an AngularJS application, which implements a solution to a simple text [encoding][https://github.com/dasm/weirdtext] [problem][https://gist.github.com/sargo/e3a4d72fbdace178e1b6] in JavaScript. This problem is stated in terms of an interview exercise.

I demonstrate a solution to this problem and also add an interface in AngularJS for playing with the encoding.
